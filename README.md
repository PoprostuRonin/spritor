Work in progress
------------
There's a lot to do to make this project done.
This software is and will be for a long time totally unusable for most people and that's OK. There is many things to do like:
* Internationalization
* Tooltips
* Group name edit
* Generate progress indicator
* Preview scaling
* Render interval

And many more...
